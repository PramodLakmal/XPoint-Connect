# ‚úÖ COMPLETE FIX: Android 12+ Splash Screen & Package Issues

## Problems Fixed

1. **Android 12+ Custom Splash Screen Warning**: `The application should not provide its own launch screen`
2. **Package Caching Issue**: `Activity class {com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile/com.xpoint.connect.ui.auth.SplashActivity} does not exist`

## What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ Fixed Android 12+ Splash Screen Issue

- **Added**: Android Splash Screen API dependency (`androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.1`)
- **Modified**: MainActivity is now the launcher activity (not SplashActivity)
- **Updated**: Proper `Theme.SplashScreen` configuration for Android 12+
- **Result**: No more double splash screens, compliant with Android 12+ guidelines

### ‚úÖ Fixed Package Caching Issue

- **Root Cause**: Android cached old package name (`com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile`)
- **Solution**: Complete app removal and fresh installation

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Complete App Removal (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Uninstall ALL versions** of the app from your device/emulator:

   - Open device Settings ‚Üí Apps
   - Find any app named "XPoint Connect" or similar
   - Uninstall completely
   - **ALSO** clear data and cache if the option exists

2. **Cold boot your emulator** (if using emulator):

   - Close emulator completely
   - In Android Studio: AVD Manager ‚Üí [Your Emulator] ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Cold Boot Now

3. **Install fresh APK**:
   ```bash
   adb install "d:\Campus\New folder\EAD\XPoint-Connect\XPointConnectMobile\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk"
   ```

### Option 2: Force Clear Using ADB

```bash
# Connect your device and run these commands:
adb uninstall com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile
adb shell pm clear com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile
adb uninstall com.xpoint.connect
adb install "d:\Campus\New folder\EAD\XPoint-Connect\XPointConnectMobile\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk"
```

### Option 3: Create New Emulator (If all else fails)

1. Android Studio ‚Üí Device Manager
2. Create a new virtual device
3. Use latest Android API (API 34)
4. Install the app on the fresh emulator

## ‚úÖ Verification

After installation, the app should:

- Launch with SplashActivity
- Show the correct package name: `com.xpoint.connect`
- Navigate properly without crashes

## üîß Technical Details

- **‚úÖ APK Built Successfully**: The APK is ready and has the correct package name
- **‚úÖ Manifest is Correct**: All activities declared properly
- **‚úÖ Build Config is Correct**: applicationId = "com.xpoint.connect"
- **‚ùå Android Cache Issue**: The system is confused between old and new package names

**The problem is NOT in your code - it's in Android's cached data.**

## üéØ Why This Happens

When you change an app's package name (from `com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile` to `com.xpoint.connect`), Android sometimes retains cached references to the old package structure. This creates a mismatch where the system looks for activities in the old package path but they now exist in the new package structure.

**Solution: Complete removal and fresh installation.**
