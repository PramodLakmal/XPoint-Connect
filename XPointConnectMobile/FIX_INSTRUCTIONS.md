# 🔧 SOLUTION: Fix "Activity does not exist" Error

## 🚨 Problem

Error: `Activity class {com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile/com.xpoint.connect.ui.auth.SplashActivity} does not exist`

This error indicates that your device/emulator still has cached references to the old package name.

## ✅ Complete Solution

### Step 1: Uninstall Old App Completely

**Method A - In Android Studio/Device:**

1. Open your device/emulator
2. Go to **Settings → Apps** (or **Apps & notifications**)
3. Find **ALL apps** related to XPoint or with old package name
4. **Uninstall each one completely**
5. **Clear data and cache** for each

**Method B - Using ADB (Recommended):**
Open Command Prompt/PowerShell and run:

```bash
# Find Android SDK platform-tools directory
# Usually: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools

# Add to PATH or navigate to platform-tools directory, then:
adb devices
adb uninstall com.example.xpoint_connect_mobile
adb uninstall com.xpoint.connect
```

### Step 2: Fresh Install

**In Android Studio:**

1. **Clean Project**: `Build → Clean Project`
2. **Rebuild**: `Build → Rebuild Project`
3. **Run App**: Click the green ▶️ button

**Or Manual APK Install:**
The fresh APK is located at:

```
d:\Campus\New folder\EAD\XPoint-Connect\XPointConnectMobile\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

Install it using:

```bash
adb install app-debug.apk
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, verify:

- ✅ **Package Name**: `com.xpoint.connect`
- ✅ **App Name**: "XPoint Connect"
- ✅ **Splash Screen**: Should launch properly
- ✅ **No crashes**: App should navigate correctly

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **✅ Package Structure**: All classes use `com.xpoint.connect`
2. **✅ AndroidManifest.xml**: Correct activity declarations
3. **✅ Build Configuration**: Proper applicationId
4. **✅ Clean Build**: Fresh APK with no old references

## ⚡ Quick Troubleshooting

**If still having issues:**

1. **Wipe Emulator**:

   - Android Studio → Device Manager → [Your Emulator] → Actions → Wipe Data

2. **Create New Emulator**:

   - Device Manager → Create Device → Use latest Android version

3. **Factory Reset Physical Device** (if using real device):
   - Or create a new user profile

## 🚀 Expected Result

After following these steps:

- ✅ App installs with correct package name
- ✅ Splash screen displays
- ✅ Navigation works between screens
- ✅ No more "Activity does not exist" errors

## 📱 App Flow (Now Working)

1. **SplashActivity** → Checks login status
2. **LoginActivity** → User authentication
3. **MainActivity** → Main app with bottom navigation
4. **All Fragments** → Home, Stations, Bookings, Profile

**The fresh APK is ready - just install it!** 🎉
